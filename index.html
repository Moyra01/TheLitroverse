        // PAGE 1
        `As l drag my suitcase on the gravel road that leads from our house. I was in a hurry, I had to leave now before my mother changed her mind. But, a memory that l had plunged deep in my sub-consciousness chose to surface just at that time. <em>Seven-year-old me holding a knife to my chest and ready to plunge it through my heart and end I all. It was blunt, and the trip to sharpening it against a rock would have earned me questions from my mother who was stripping down the clothes l had washed into the dirt because they were not clean enough. Coward, couldn’t even bring myself to be seen sharpening a knife by my mother because that’s how much she scared me.</em>Another mind drifted to when l obsessed over our pictures looking for similarities, l hoped l had been the case of those kids who were switched at birth  by those nurses who did it for fun and especially when they didn’t like you. But even that, was a dead end because l was light in complexion like her, flat tummy, big breast and a generous behind. I was my mother’s daughter alright. I looked at our joined core house one last time, dug a little hole like my mother used to force me whenever l did anything new she didn’t like which was almost always and spit in it, but this time to swear never to step foot into this house again. 
        // PAGE 2
        I had held on before because my brain was my hope, l am smart. But then as years went by l realized it wasn’t as abc as it was before. Graduates would come back and sit around the bridges corners, and wake up in their graduation gowns regalia to sweep their yards and gossip with others as if they didn’t learn anything about class and manners to become world class citizens in their tertiary education. By the time l wrote my A levels the hope that educations would take me out of my situation had dwindled down. I still came out with twenty points because anything less than that my mother would leave me with other scars, and because as much as education isn’t key to money it is key to success. A perfect training environment for the brain.

        `It didn’t take time for me to settle down when l got to university campus, after all my life was packed into my one big suitcase.<br>
My Itel cell phone rang dragging me from thoughts, it took me a minute to calm down my heart from the marathon it took when l saw the caller id.<br><br>

Mom : wafamba zvakanaka here Tadiwa? Zvauriwe utangise kumhanyisa tsuro mbiri uchiita zvausina kufambira. Ndati uuye nedegree ikoko kwete tuvana tusina baba. Ukaita zvekutamba mari yacho yefees unoibhadhara wega! Urikundinzwa here iwe unongoramba wakanyara.<br>
(Did you travel well Tadiwa? Can you please refrain from your habit of focusing on other things besides school. You can only come back here with a degree and not kids who don’t have fathers. If you think l am joking l will leave you to pay your fees on your own. Are you even listening to me, when all you do is remain quiet.)<br><br>

Tadiwa: hongu mhamha, ndiri…<br>
(Yes mom, l…)<br>
Mom: watotanga kumera zenze kungoona Harare kaa? Ndinouya ikoko ndikatora mari yangu tigoona unoita sei. Handidi kunzwa mastories kubva ikoko. Ziva zvawafambira. Urege kutandanisa tsuro mbiri.<br>
(You have already begun to be mischievous because you are now in Harare? I will come there and collect my money which l paid for fees. I don’t want to hear funny stories from there. Know why you went there in the first place and focus solely on that).<br><br>

All of it comes rushing down on me, the beatings, the scars, the threats, the shouting, and the scolding. I held it together for years hoping that one day l would be free. Now l am. Miles and miles away from her and l am still subjected to such? No mhani, this is my now freedom. Let it end.<br><br>

I disconnect her call and remove my sim-card, break it into half and throw it into the cardboard box that serves as my bin. I remove all the clothes that l had neatly folded into the built in wardrobe and start separating them. All the long hideous skirts and church garments my mom bought for me l throw into the bin.<br> 
I look into the mirror and l look cute in my short hair, but all of that has to go. So l take hair remover and a shaving stick. Eight minutes later l am shaving all the hair. The bald head is a symbol of the old being washed away and a new life beginning.<br><br>

After cleaning up l shred the clothes l had thrown away, lock my room to go throw them in the main trash cans and also get a new line. After the whole odeal l feel better. For nineteen years l had suck it up and waited for a time l would be independent and never have to depend on my parents again. This was far enough l couldn’t do another four years of the life that l lived. I have already given them nineteen years. Its enough now.
