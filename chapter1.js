    <h1>Chapter 1: Queen of Chaos</h1>
    <p class="quote">• “A child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth.”</p>

    <p>When the first round of hot gossip about me allegedly sleeping with married men for sexual favors hit the streets of our tiny community, I was thrilled. <strong>Yes, thrilled.</strong> I thought, “Finally! The community will rally together, ask the hard questions, and maybe—just maybe—help my mother discipline her wild child.” Spoiler alert: they did not and I desperately needed and wanted the disciplinary committee because it would be my chance to spill.</p>
    <p>In my head, I had multiple dramatic scenarios. The most vivid? The community tying a tyre around the neck of whichever husband I was allegedly with and setting him ablaze like the South Africans did. I mean, the only justice I wanted was the mob justice but it never came.</p>
    <p><strong>Varume hatina zera navo, I tell you.</strong> (Loosely translated to: Men will embarrass you.) The woman sitting across me was weeping like she was Job’s wife who had just lost all her kids, her goats, and her will to live. Meanwhile, the rest of the family looked like they were waiting for the next episode of <em>Generations</em>. Typical husband’s family behavior—emotionally absent but always present for the drama.</p>

    <p>“He didn’t say he’s leaving you, makoti. Now you’ll know where he is all the time and won’t have to wonder which bitch he’s with,” one aunty chimed in. You know the type—ex-soldier vibes, eloped at 19, came back with five kids and a failed marriage, now dispensing unsolicited wisdom like expired Panado. She’s exactly that type. Her logic? Justifying cheating husbands with the grace of a drunk philosopher.</p>
    <p>But I couldn’t say anything, could I? I was the reason for the tears, the heartbreak, the emotional tsunami. Still, I didn’t owe her anything. Not a tissue, not a hug, not even a fake apology.</p>
    <p>“Makoti, come so I can show you around the house,” my new mother-in-law said. If it were up to me, I’d live in an apartment in town, and the husband could visit. But apparently, being the religious pillar of the community meant we all had to live in one house like a dysfunctional sitcom cast. She gave me the grand tour, and honestly, if I wasn’t so deep in my own thoughts, I’d have been impressed by the décor. My room looked like Pinterest had thrown up in it—in a good way.</p>
    <p>Later, there was a soft knock on the door. Before I could say “come in,” the door creaked open. I sighed in relief—it was the wife. The original one. The OG.</p>
    <p>“Right now, you think you’ve made it,” she began, dramatic as ever. “But trust me, one day soon, you’ll be me. Crying your heart out because he took a third and a fourth. You’ll feel the pain. You’ll experience the other side of homewrecking. How you got him is how you’ll lose him. Mark my words.”</p>

    <p>I walked to the door, peeked down the corridor—ghost town. I closed the door and turned to her.</p>
    <p>“I’ve heard you,” I said calmly. “But did you hear me ten years ago when I came to you about your husband touching me inappropriately? I was brave. I told you things no one else would. And what did you do? Nothing. Your community? Also nothing. So don’t preach to me about karma—I made peace with mine nine years ago.”</p>
    <p>She sniffled, tears rolling down her face like a broken tap. But I remained stoic. This didn’t make me cry anymore. I had cried enough to fill Lake Kariba.</p>
    <p>“You’re hoping karma deals with me? Then pray that your karma leaves you alive long enough to witness mine. Because guess what? I am your karma, and you might die before you see mine. Right now, focus on yourself. Bitch!”</p>
    <p>She froze, eyes wide like she’d seen a ghost in a wig. I smiled, walked to the door, and held it open like a polite villain. She walked out, spooked. But it was too early for that—I hadn’t even started.</p>
    <p><strong>They say it takes a village to raise a child. Well, let’s see what this village raised.</strong> Spoiler: it wasn’t a saint.</p>
