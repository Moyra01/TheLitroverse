    <h2>Chapter 2: Black Sheep</h2>
    <blockquote><em>“When there is no enemy within, the enemies outside cannot hurt you.”</em></blockquote>
    <p><strong>Austin</strong></p>
    <p>I never look forward to going back home. In fact, I avoid that place like a cursed shrine. The only reason I’m walking toward their lounging area after ten years is because I can’t stand my mother’s tears. I told that man, if he ever laid a hand on my mother again, his family would have nothing to bury but hands and feet. <strong>Period.</strong></p>
    <p>There’s laughter inside. And if I didn’t know this bunch, I’d say it sounded like happiness. But the moment I come into view, the room goes dead silent. Like I’m devil’s advocate, they fear.</p>
    <p>I scan the room for my mother. She’s not here. I pull out my phone and call her. She answers just as the call is about to drop, she sounds like she was sleeping. <strong>Red flag 1.</strong></p>
    <p>“Where are you, Mama?” I ask.</p>
    <p>“You don’t greet anymore, Austin?” she replies, all soft and passive-aggressive.</p>
    <p>I crack my knuckles. Frustrated.</p>
    <p>“I do, Mama. I was just worried about you.”</p>
    <p>“I’m fine. I was just sleeping.”</p>
    <p>“Since when do you sleep in the afternoon?”</p>
    <p>“You… you… Why are you asking?” she stammers.</p>
    <p><strong>‘Come downstairs l am waiting for you.’</strong> I drop the call before she can say anything.</p>
    <p>Now I know something’s fishy. My mother doesn’t nap in the afternoon. She’s usually up and down hosting every stray relative and nosy neighbor who walks into her yard. And this crowd? Prime hosting material. But she’s missing.</p>

    <p>Then comes the voice. The one that can make your blood pressure spike.</p>
    <p><strong>“So you don’t even see us? You come back from wherever you were and just stare at us like we’re vomit, neeh?”</strong> says the family witch.</p>
    <p>I ignore her and walk deeper into the room, standing by the arch that faces the stairs. I want to see my mother descend the stairs. If I find anything wrong with her, there shall be wailing. My father is already sweating bullets. And when my mother finally appears—no bruises—I know he’s upgraded his abuse tactics. No more fists. Just psychological warfare.</p>
    <p>She smiles at me, but it doesn’t reach her eyes. I walk to meet her halfway. She hugs me. I know she’s crying because she doesn’t want to let go.</p>
    <p>“What’s wrong, Mama?” I ask. She’s cried over this man before, but this time? This is deep. This is soul-level pain.</p>
    <p><strong>“Your mother is just being a baby. People take second wives all the time. There’s nothing special about her,”</strong> says my father’s advocate, the witch.</p>
    <p>The silence that follows is so loud, everyone is waiting for me to lose it.</p>
    <p><strong>“Why are you staying, Mama? Do you even have a breaking point? What will it take for you to leave this man?”</strong></p>
    <p>Cue the laughter. The kind that’s not funny. The provoking kind.</p>
    <p><strong>“Ha ha ha! Can you see how old she looks? How worn out she is? Even with all that mud she puts on her face, she couldn’t attract an old man on his deathbed. Don’t be funny, Austin. Who do you think would want her now? After all, the only reason she got my brother back in the day is because she’s a witch that—”</strong></p>
    <p>She doesn’t finish her sentence because she’s now choking. On her own words. And my hand.</p>
    <p>I’m in my zone. She’s kicking, scratching, trying to slap my hand away. But she shouldn’t be turning blue this fast. It’s not even my whole hand around her neck—just a few fingers and her fat neck doing the rest of the work.</p>

    <p>Then my mother begins to recite our clan praises. Calm. Regal. Like she is trying to calm a storm.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>“Oh mighty Chitova, leg of strength and grace,<br>
      You carry the weight, yet hold a peaceful face.<br>
      Strong as the limb that stands firm in the storm,<br>
      Calm flows through you, steady and warm.<br>
      Remember Madyirapazhe, the pride of your name,<br>
      Who conquered with wisdom, not with flame.<br>
      Temper like the leg that bears but does not break,<br>
      Rise above anger for harmony’s sake.<br>
      Chitova, you are the pillar, the steadfast root,<br>
      In your calm hands, the clan takes its fruit.<br>
      Let not wrath cloud the name you bear,<br>
      For strength is in peace and the love you share.”</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I drop her to the floor just as my mother finishes. My aunt gasps for air like a fish out of water. I turn to the room.</p>
    <p><strong>“Does anyone have anything to say?”</strong> I ask, finally addressing the crowd.</p>
    <p><strong>Crickets.</strong> If you are not part of this family, I expect you to be gone before I get to 5. Gasps. I don’t even get to 2 before the room is clear of the gossipmongers that were here. <strong>Cowards.</strong></p>
    <p>I look across the room and my eyes settle on Her. Face of a sixteen-year-old, body of a mature African woman, and smooth skin. I croak my head as if trying to understand her, and she stares back at me.</p>
    <p><strong>‘That is your second mum son,’</strong> the devil’s son says. I mask my shock and chuckle.</p>
    <p><strong>‘Well, looks like it's going to be fun being back home.’</strong> Gasps, yeah, people are shocked, well, me too. I guess I’m moving back in. <strong>Home sweet home!</strong></p>
